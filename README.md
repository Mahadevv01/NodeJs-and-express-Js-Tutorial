# Node.js and Express.js Concepts with Deployment on DigitalOcean

## Introduction

This repository is a showcase of my learning journey, where I explored the following:

- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows building server-side and networking applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
- **Deployment on DigitalOcean**: Hosting a Node.js application on a cloud platform like DigitalOcean, covering the setup of a Virtual Private Server (VPS), installing necessary tools, and deploying the application for production.

## Node.js Overview

Node.js is a runtime that enables JavaScript to run on the server-side. It is event-driven, non-blocking, and asynchronous, making it ideal for building fast and scalable network applications. Some of the key features include:

- **Single-threaded architecture**: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it efficient for handling multiple concurrent connections.
- **Asynchronous execution**: Code execution in Node.js doesn't wait for tasks like file reading or database querying to complete.
- **Package management**: Node.js uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage third-party libraries and dependencies.

### Key Node.js Concepts

- **Event Loop**: Node.js operates asynchronously using an event loop that handles all the I/O operations.
- **Callbacks and Promises**: These are used for handling asynchronous code in Node.js.
- **Modules**: Node.js uses a module system, with `require()` to import and `module.exports` to export.
  
## Express.js Overview

Express.js is a fast, minimalist framework for building web applications on Node.js. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by offering a range of built-in middleware and HTTP utility methods.
